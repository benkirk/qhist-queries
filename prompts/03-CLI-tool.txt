Consider the python ORMs in @qhist_db/models.py and sample queries in @qhist_db/queries.py

I would like to create a CLI tool with the following features:
(1) takes a date range as input for analysis over a specific time window,
(2) supports output grouping of several flavors (Year/Quarter, Year/Month, Daily),
(3) supports a wide range of queries:
  - number of unique users,
  - number of unique projects,
  - number of jobs per user per account for given timefrme,

This is the time history view.

I would also like a resource-centric view for the same timeframe - for example see the Derecho ASCII data files in @samples/

Creating these from the CLI tool for the specified data range would be another mode of operation.

See @README.md for how the database currently operates and lets develop a plan.
